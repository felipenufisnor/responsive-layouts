Responsive Layouts: working with mobile layouts

In this code I continued the web page development journey.
I optimized the use of Emmet, a tool to speed up code writing.
Improved code maintenance with CSS variables.
I wrote semantic codes that help with accessibility and SEO. Finally, I learned to deal with adapting different layouts and improved my knowledge of responsiveness.
